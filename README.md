news_grouped_by_date
====================

Custom ViewHelper for TYPO3 Versatile News System. Lists news items by Date eg. year

I was inspired by this gist: https://gist.github.com/daKmoR/1287203
Also took the viewHelper Code. Put this all together in a small TYPO3 extension
with one demo template to replace the standard news List.html
